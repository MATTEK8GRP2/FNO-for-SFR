In this module the relative $\ell_2$ error is implemented. This is used as the
loss both during training and testing as described in the report

        Fourier Neural Operators for Sound Field Reconstruction
                        in the Time Domain
           - Chapter 7: Temporal Sound Field Reconstruction
                - Chapter 8: Numerical Experiments

This module is used in the scripts train_FNO_network_2d.py,
validation_err_vs_res_plot.py, and test_FNO_network_2d.py.

The script has been developed using Python 3.6 with the library torch 1.7.0.
