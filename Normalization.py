In this script the constant used for normalizing the data is computed and the
class used for normlizing and un-normalizing the data is introduced. This is
done as described in the report

        Fourier Neural Operators for Sound Field Reconstruction
                        in the Time Domain
           - Chapter 7: Temporal Sound Field Reconstruction
                    
This functionality is used in the scripts train_FNO_network_2d.py,
validation_err_vs_res_plot.py, and test_FNO_network_2d.py.

The script has been developed using Python 3.6 with the
libraries numpy, scipy, and torch 1.7.0.
